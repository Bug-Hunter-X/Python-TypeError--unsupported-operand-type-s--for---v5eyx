This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python that can occur when performing division. The `bug.py` file contains code that attempts to divide an integer by a string, which results in a `TypeError`. The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to handle this error using a `try-except` block. This example highlights the importance of input validation and type checking to prevent such errors.
